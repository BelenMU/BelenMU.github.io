## About Me
I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech, advised by [Matthieu Bloch](https://bloch.ece.gatech.edu/) and [Christopher Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu/rozell.html). My research focuses on efficiently teaching machine learning algorithms with a particular interest in human feedback. I am set to complete my Ph.D. in May 2026, with the goal of continuing my journey in academia.

 I began my academic career at Universidad de Navarra, where I obtained both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Telecommunications Engineering. I later moved to Georgia Tech for my Ph.D. and have had the opportunity to collaborate internationally, including a research visit to ETH Zurich with [Andreas Krause]([Andreas Krause | Learning & Adaptive Systems Group (ethz.ch)](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea)). My research seeks to leverage knowledgeable teachers—whether human experts or powerful machine learning networks—to enhance learning algorithm performance. Outside of research, I am passionate about teaching, mentoring students, and promoting women in STEM fields.
